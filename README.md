ðŸš¨ Warning - Use at Your Own Risk ðŸš¨
This project is intended for educational purposes only. The features contained in this code are potentially harmful and can be misused. Please be cautious when using this.

Features & Risks:
Account Compromise: The code has the ability to change the associated email address on a Roblox account while leaving the password unchanged. This can lock users out of their account, as they won't be able to recover it without access to the new email address.

Inaccurate Birthdate: The code may set the account's birthdate to a value that suggests the user is under 13 years old. This can prevent the account from being recovered and could also violate Roblox's terms of service.

Instructions:
Be Cautious Before Running:
Before running the code, remove the line in the index.html file (line 81). You are not required to do this step, but for security and account safety, it is highly recommended to follow this modification if you want to protect your account.

Customization:
You are free to modify or resell the code as you see fit, but please exercise caution and use it responsibly.

Disclaimer:
This project comes with no warranties. If you choose to run or modify this code, you do so at your own risk. The creator is not responsible for any loss of accounts or other consequences that may arise from using this project.
